# Windows XP in HTML, Javascript, and CSS

## Desktop Specification
* The desktop will be a grid of possible drag and drop targets where icons can be dropped. Grid will be a
2d array of cells.
* Multiple objects can be selected, dragged, and dropped at a time. Items repositioned in this manner
will fall into the closest available cells.
* Icons will not move until they are dropped. A partially transparent icon will appear next to the mouse when
the drag is in progress.
